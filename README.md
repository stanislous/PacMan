# PacMan

This is a multiplayer game similar to PacMan. Play begins once four players have joined in. They score points by collecting 
coloured dots on a 10x10 grid. Red, green and blue dots count for one, two and, four points respectively. When two players 
collide they lose three points each. The game ends when all dots on the board have been collected.
